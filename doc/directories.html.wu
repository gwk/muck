# Directory Assets



# Directory Targets

Directories can be targets as well as files.

For a given product file with a directory source, it is not possible for any parent directory to be a product,
because the direct source lives in that directory.

However it is possible for an auxiliary product to be placed in an arbitrary directory.
This means that the aux product could be placed into a directory that was itself the product of a different step.




# Test scenarios

* add asset
* remove asset
* target dir from asset to product.


product dir produced by script
* adds files
* removes files
* change target dir from product to asset.
